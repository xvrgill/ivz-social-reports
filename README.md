## Future Improvements

The code written here will be used to provide key metrics to segment marketing teams in order to optimize content by enabling data driven decision making. While the primary goal is to provide stakeholders with relevant insights into content performance, the underlying aspiration is to turn these insights into intelligible dashboards that can decrease strain on the firm's social analysts when it comes to repeatedly generating these insights from scratch.

Our process now:
1. Retrieve in platform data and load it into Excel
2. Use Excel to find performance insights and to evaluate key metrics
3. Transfer findings into PowerPoint and add visuals
4. Present findings to the respective internal team
5. Follow up with any additional insights based on the discussion

There are several issues with this process, namely that our team no longer has the capacity to both generate these reports by hand and to present them to every internal team that requests them. For this reason, we have moved to a system of written reports that each team can follow up on as needed.

Even these written reports are time-consuming, which is why a set of advanced dashboards would be preferential. Segment teams can access the dashboards at any point in time for reporting to leadership or campaign monitoring and can subsequently follow up with our team directly for clarification on specific points.

An issue that has plagued data intesive work across the board is the idea that data solves everything. While it is true that data can offer a great deal of perfromance insight, it is exceedingly difficult to do that without a set of very specific business problems that you want the data to solve.

The process as it exists today is very cumbersome because we are not asking those specific questions, but instad are simply using data as a catch all
