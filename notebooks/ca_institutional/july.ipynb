    "While we could calculate the top performers for each of our features or select a singular feature that is most important to us, that approach would be problematic for the following reasons:\n",

    "1. It isn't providing the end user with the entire picture - that isn't how an analyst determines which posts performed the best overall so neither should our computations\n",
    "2. It's convoluted - there would be either too much information or a need to explain why a majority of the information was ostracized from consideration\n",
